This is a tool that can compose or decompose kanji by whether a component is in a kanji's ideographic description sequence. Does not handle positioning. Output is sorted by stroke count, then value. Stroke count is estimated if there is no data for it. ids.txt comes from https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids/

This is a fork of https://github.com/wareya/ids_rust/ , intended to be used as a library
to integrate into other Rust projects.
